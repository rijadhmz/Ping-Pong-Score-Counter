## Ping Pong Score Counter

This project involves building a Ping Pong Score Counter using HTML, CSS with Bootstrap 5, and plain JavaScript. The Ping Pong Score Counter allows users to keep track of scores between two players in a ping pong game.

### Project Description

The Ping Pong Score Counter provides a user-friendly interface to track scores for two players in a ping pong match. It features buttons to increment the score by 1 for each player, a 'Play to:' selector to set the winning score (defaulting to 5 points), and a reset button to restart the game. When a player reaches the specified winning score, the game ends, and the winning player's score changes color to green, while the losing player's score changes to red.

### Challenge Requirement

The project fulfills the following functionalities:

1. Two buttons to increase the score for Player 1 and Player 2 respectively.
2. A 'Play to:' selector allowing users to set the winning score limit (defaulting to 5 points).
3. A reset button to restart the game and reset scores to zero.
4. Dynamic score updates displayed for each player.
5. Change of score color based on the winner/loser after reaching the winning score.

### Implementation Details
